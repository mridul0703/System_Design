# 101. System Design Overview

System Design is the blueprint behind how systems are structured, how they work internally, and how they scale under load. It defines how data flows, components interact, and what design principles are applied to achieve **reliability, scalability, and performance**.

## 🎯 Why Learn System Design?

Understanding system design helps you build systems that are **robust, scalable, and maintainable** — vital skills for real-world software engineering.

- ✅ **Crucial for FAANG/Product Interviews** – Often a key part of senior technical interviews.
- ✅ **Needed for Senior Roles** – Helps you design and evaluate solutions at scale.
- ✅ **Improves Communication** – Explains systems better to peers and stakeholders.
- ✅ **Enhances Job Security** – Valuable knowledge in architecture keeps you in demand.
- ✅ **Boosts Decision-Making** – Helps pick the right tools, patterns, and design approaches.

## 🎯 Objectives of System Design

A well-designed system should be **user-centered, cost-effective**, and capable of growing with demand.

- ✅ **Practicality** – Focused on actual user and business needs.
- ✅ **Accuracy** – Meets all defined functional and non-functional requirements.
- ✅ **Completeness** – Covers all expected use cases and scenarios.
- ✅ **Efficiency** – Uses resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) wisely.
- ✅ **Reliability** – Runs consistently without frequent failures.
- ✅ **Optimization** – Time/space optimized like good code.
- ✅ **Scalability** – Can handle more users/data with time.
- ✅ **Fault Tolerance** – Continues working even if some parts fail.

## ✅ Advantages of System Design

System Design provides a foundation for **fast, clean, and scalable development**.

- 🚀 **Lower Design Costs** – Reuse of known patterns and best practices.
- ⚡ **Faster Development** – Frameworks and tools reduce build time.
- ⏳ **Time Saving in SDLC** – Efficient iterations across development stages.
- 🧠 **Better Consistency** – Standardized structure across teams and codebases.
- 🧰 **Resource Optimization** – Saves hardware, time, and team efforts.
- 💡 **Promotes Creativity** – Encourages thinking across APIs, DBs, and services.

## 🧩 Components of System Design

Key building blocks of modern system architecture, each solving a specific problem.

- **Load Balancers** – Distribute traffic to avoid overloading servers.
- **Key-Value Stores** – Fast data access for caching and simple storage.
- **Blob Storage** – Handles large files like videos, images (e.g., S3).
- **Databases** – Store structured data for applications.
- **Rate Limiters** – Prevent misuse of resources by throttling requests.
- **Monitoring Tools** – Watch system performance, uptime, and health.
- **Messaging Queues** – Enable async processing across services.
- **Unique ID Generators** – Ensure each record or event has a distinct ID.
- **Distributed Search** – Scales search across massive datasets.
- **Logging Services** – Collect logs for debugging and analysis.
- **Task Schedulers** – Manage scheduled and recurring jobs efficiently.

## 🔁 System Design Life Cycle (SDLC)

A structured approach to designing systems that aligns with development goals.

> **Phases include:**
1. **Requirement Analysis** – Understand what’s needed.
2. **System Design** – Blueprint of architecture and components.
3. **Implementation** – Coding begins.
4. **Testing** – Ensure system works as intended.
5. **Deployment** – Ship to production.
6. **Maintenance** – Updates, monitoring, and scaling.

🧠 Good design at this stage prevents major issues later.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Defines how all system components interact and function together.

### Popular Architecture Patterns

- 🖥 **Client-Server** – Split between users and data/service providers.
- ⚡ **Event-Driven** – Uses events for decoupled, reactive systems.
- 🧩 **Microkernel** – Lightweight core with pluggable modules.
- 🧱 **Microservices** – Small services with independent logic and deployment.

Each pattern suits different kinds of apps depending on **scale and flexibility** needed.

---

## ⚙️ Modularity & Interfaces

Design systems to be **easy to maintain, extend, and integrate**.

- 🧩 **Modularity** – Break big systems into independent parts (modules).
    - Easier testing, reuse, and parallel development.
- 🔌 **Interfaces** – How components or users interact with the system.
    - APIs, GUIs, forms — all need to be intuitive and consistent.

Together, they make systems **scalable, testable, and user-friendly**.

---

## 📈 System Evolution & Scaling

As user demand grows, systems must be able to scale without crashing.

### 1. 🚀 Vertical Scaling
- Add more RAM/CPU to the same machine.
- Simple but limited by hardware capacity.

### 2. 🏗️ Horizontal Scaling
- Add more servers and distribute load.
- Complex but enables massive growth.

🎯 Design for **scalability and availability** from day one.

## 🔄 Data Flow in System

Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) represent how data moves and transforms in a system.

### DFD Elements:
- 🔲 **Square** – External entities (PASSENGER, AGENT)
- ➡️ **Arrow** – Data flows (flight request, response)
- ⚪ **Circle** – Process or transformation
- 🗂️ **Open Rectangle** – Data store (temp or permanent)

📌 Use **uppercase** for all square-box entities as a good practice.

## ✈️ Airline Reservation System (Example)

A practical example showing real-life application of design concepts.

### Entities:
- **PASSENGER** – Initiates booking
- **TRAVEL AGENT** – Acts as mediator
- **AIRLINE** – Confirms availability and issues ticket

### Flow:
1. Passenger requests → Agent → Airline
2. Ticket is issued or reservation queued
3. System handles unavailability via alternate booking options

✅ Great demo for data flow, user interaction, and modular architecture.
